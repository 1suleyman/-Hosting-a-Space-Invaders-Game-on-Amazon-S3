# 🌌 Hosting My Space Invaders Game on Amazon S3

I decided to host my **Space Invaders game** on Amazon S3 to make it publicly playable. This project walked me through **creating an S3 bucket**, **uploading my game files**, and **configuring static website hosting**. By the end, anyone can play my game via a public URL! 🪣🎮

## 📋 Project Steps

### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**

**Goal:** Set up a storage space for my game files.

**What I did:**

1. Logged into the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigated to **Amazon S3**.
3. Clicked **Create bucket** and named it:

   ```text
   suleymans-space-invaders-game
   ```

💡 **Tip:** Bucket names must be **globally unique** — no one else can use the same name.

4. Enabled **ACLs** and **public read access**.

💡 **Do I need to enable versioning?**
For a small portfolio project like this, I left **versioning disabled**. It’s useful for data recovery, but it **adds extra storage costs**, and I can easily re-upload files if needed. 💰

💡 **What are ACLs?**
ACLs (Access Control Lists) let me control **who can access and modify individual objects** in the bucket, unlike bucket policies, which apply to the entire bucket.

💡 **Do I need to allow public access?**
Yes. To make my game playable online, I had to enable **public read access**. This works fine for a portfolio project. For production, I would use **CloudFront** for security, HTTPS, and faster global performance.

5. Took a **screenshot** of my newly created bucket.

✅ **Checkpoint:** S3 bucket created successfully!

### **Step 2: Upload Game Files**

**Goal:** Upload my Space Invaders game files (HTML, CSS, JS) to S3.

**What I did:**

1. Prepared my game folder:

```
space-invaders/
├── index.html      <-- main game page
├── style.css       <-- game styles
└── game.js         <-- game logic
```

2. Uploaded **all files** to my S3 bucket.

💡 **What are HTML, CSS, and JS?**

* **HTML** = structure of my game (canvas, buttons, layout)
* **CSS** = visual styles (colors, positions, appearance)
* **JavaScript** = game logic (movement, collisions, scoring)

3. Took a **screenshot** of my bucket’s **Objects tab** showing all uploaded files.

✅ **Checkpoint:** Game files uploaded successfully.

### **Step 3: Configure Static Website Hosting**

**Goal:** Make my Space Invaders game playable online.

**What I did:**

1. Went to the **Properties** section of my S3 bucket.
2. Enabled **Static website hosting**.
3. Set the **Index document** to:

```
index.html
```

4. Noted the **endpoint URL** generated by AWS.

💡 **Why hosting is necessary:**
Even if the game works locally, it won’t be accessible online until hosted. S3 provides a URL that anyone can use to play my game.

5. Tested the URL.
   ❌ Initially, I saw an error because **all S3 objects are private by default**.

6. Fixed it by adding a **bucket policy** to allow public read:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::suleymans-space-invaders-game/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

7. I also realized I had uploaded the **folder itself**, instead of just the files, which caused a **404 error**. I corrected it by uploading only the contents.

8. Finally, I tested the URL again, and my **Space Invaders game loaded perfectly** in the browser.

✅ **Checkpoint:** Static website hosting configured successfully!

## 💡 Notes / Tips

* **ACLs vs. Bucket Policies:** ACLs control individual files; bucket policies control the whole bucket.
* **Website Hosting:** All game files must be **public** to play online.
* **Versioning:** Not required for small portfolio projects; helps save costs.
* **CloudFront for Production:** For a production site, use CloudFront for better security, HTTPS, and global performance.
