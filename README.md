# 🌌 Hosting a Space Invaders Game on Amazon S3

This project guides you through **creating an S3 bucket**, **uploading your Space Invaders game files**, and **configuring static website hosting** on AWS. By the end, your game will be playable via a public URL! 🪣🎮

---

## 📋 Project Steps

### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**

**Goal:** Create a storage space for your game files.

#### Instructions:

1. Log in to your **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **Amazon S3**.
3. Click **Create bucket** and name it:

   ```bash
   <your-name>-space-invaders-game
   ```
I chose suleymans-space-invaders-game

💡 **Tip:** Bucket names must be **globally unique**. Once a name is taken, no other AWS account can use it.

4. Enable **ACLs** and **public read access**.

💡 **Do I need to enable versioning?**
For a simple portfolio project like this, **versioning is not required**. Versioning is useful for data recovery and protecting against accidental overwrites, but it **increases storage costs**. Since this is a small project and files can easily be re-uploaded, it’s cost-effective to leave versioning **disabled**. 💰

💡 **What are ACLs?**
ACLs (Access Control Lists) control **who can access and modify objects** in your bucket. They let you manage access per file, unlike bucket policies, which control access for the entire bucket.

💡 **Do I need to allow all public access?**
Yes, to make your website viewable by anyone, **public read access is required**. This is fine for a portfolio project. For production apps, it’s better to keep the bucket private and use **Amazon CloudFront** as a CDN for:

* **Security:** Restrict access to the S3 bucket via a secure URL
* **Performance:** Cache files at edge locations for faster loading worldwide
* **HTTPS:** Serve your site securely with a free SSL/TLS certificate

5. Take a **screenshot** of your newly created bucket.

✅ **Checkpoint:** S3 bucket created successfully!

### **Step 2: Upload Game Files**

**Goal:** Upload your Space Invaders game files (HTML, CSS, JS) to your S3 bucket.

#### Instructions:

1. Prepare your game folder, e.g.:

```
space-invaders/
├── index.html      <-- main game page
├── style.css       <-- game styles
└── game.js         <-- game logic
```

2. Upload **all files** to your S3 bucket.

💡 **What are HTML, CSS, and JS?**

* **HTML** = structure of your game (canvas, buttons, layout)
* **CSS** = visual styles (colors, positions, appearance)
* **JavaScript** = game logic (movement, collisions, scoring)

3. Take a **screenshot** of your bucket’s **Objects tab** showing all uploaded files.

✅ **Checkpoint:** Game files uploaded successfully.

---

### **Step 3: Configure Static Website Hosting**

**Goal:** Make your Space Invaders game playable online.

#### Instructions:

1. Go to the **Properties** section of your S3 bucket.
2. Enable **Static website hosting**.
3. Set the **Index document** to:

```
index.html
```

4. Note the **endpoint URL** generated by AWS.

💡 **What does website hosting mean?**
Even if your game works perfectly on your computer, it won’t be visible online until it’s hosted. S3 static website hosting provides a URL so anyone can access and play your game.

5. Test the URL.
   ❌ You might see an error at this stage.

<img width="242" height="100" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 15 48 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/945c7b93-5b57-4177-93cb-7eff20ac02f8" />

💡 **Why the error?**
By default, all objects in S3 are private. This happens because your HTML, CSS, and JS files are still private. We enabled **public read access** in Step 1 to fix this.

I then started
<img width="222" height="101" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 16 09 00" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d4d218-e9e7-4cca-b29b-146d1dd7ab47" />

so i fixed it with a bucket policy

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::suleymans-space-invaders-game/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

i then ran into a silly error where i was getting 404 not found error and i realised i uploaded the whole folder including the folder itself space-invaders instead of just the files 


6. Take a **screenshot** of your game loading in the browser.

✅ **Checkpoint:** Static website hosting configured successfully!

# 🌌 Hosting My Space Invaders Game on Amazon S3

I decided to host my **Space Invaders game** on Amazon S3 to make it publicly playable. This project walked me through **creating an S3 bucket**, **uploading my game files**, and **configuring static website hosting**. By the end, anyone can play my game via a public URL! 🪣🎮

---

## 📋 Project Steps

### **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket**

**Goal:** Set up a storage space for my game files.

**What I did:**

1. Logged into the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigated to **Amazon S3**.
3. Clicked **Create bucket** and named it:

   ```text
   suleymans-space-invaders-game
   ```

💡 **Tip:** Bucket names must be **globally unique** — no one else can use the same name.

4. Enabled **ACLs** and **public read access**.

💡 **Do I need to enable versioning?**
For a small portfolio project like this, I left **versioning disabled**. It’s useful for data recovery, but it **adds extra storage costs**, and I can easily re-upload files if needed. 💰

💡 **What are ACLs?**
ACLs (Access Control Lists) let me control **who can access and modify individual objects** in the bucket, unlike bucket policies, which apply to the entire bucket.

💡 **Do I need to allow public access?**
Yes. To make my game playable online, I had to enable **public read access**. This works fine for a portfolio project. For production, I would use **CloudFront** for security, HTTPS, and faster global performance.

5. Took a **screenshot** of my newly created bucket.

<img width="498" height="216" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 15 36 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1882f5c-8670-4c30-ab4f-fefd79d24c4a" />

✅ **Checkpoint:** S3 bucket created successfully!

---

### **Step 2: Upload Game Files**

**Goal:** Upload my Space Invaders game files (HTML, CSS, JS) to S3.

**What I did:**

1. Prepared my game folder:

```
space-invaders/
├── index.html      <-- main game page
├── style.css       <-- game styles
└── game.js         <-- game logic
```

2. Uploaded **all files** to my S3 bucket.

💡 **What are HTML, CSS, and JS?**

* **HTML** = structure of my game (canvas, buttons, layout)
* **CSS** = visual styles (colors, positions, appearance)
* **JavaScript** = game logic (movement, collisions, scoring)

3. Took a **screenshot** of my bucket’s **Objects tab** showing all uploaded files.

<img width="483" height="338" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 15 41 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/016fc4d1-f8e6-4f46-8390-9187873b0542" />

✅ **Checkpoint:** Game files uploaded successfully.

### **Step 3: Configure Static Website Hosting**

**Goal:** Make my Space Invaders game playable online.

**What I did:**

1. Went to the **Properties** section of my S3 bucket.
2. Enabled **Static website hosting**.
3. Set the **Index document** to:

```
index.html
```

4. Noted the **endpoint URL** generated by AWS.

💡 **Why hosting is necessary:**
Even if the game works locally, it won’t be accessible online until hosted. S3 provides a URL that anyone can use to play my game.

5. Tested the URL.
   ❌ Initially, I saw an error because **all S3 objects are private by default**.

<img width="242" height="100" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 15 48 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/945c7b93-5b57-4177-93cb-7eff20ac02f8" />
<img width="222" height="101" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 16 09 00" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d4d218-e9e7-4cca-b29b-146d1dd7ab47" />

6. Fixed it by adding a **bucket policy** to allow public read:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::suleymans-space-invaders-game/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

7. I also realized I had uploaded the **folder itself**, instead of just the files, which caused a **404 error**. I corrected it by uploading only the contents.

8. Finally, I tested the URL again, and my **Space Invaders game loaded perfectly** in the browser.

<img width="1160" height="859" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 16 11 41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a789e2bc-d239-49ee-acc1-1f65a46b479c" />

✅ **Checkpoint:** Static website hosting configured successfully!
